# node-react-emaily-app
This is an email application following [Stephen Grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider)'s Node with React: Fullstack Web Development Course on Udemy. This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.

The email application allows users to login (using OAUTH through Google) to send surveys individuals (similar to MailChimp) using SendGrid. The application uses Stripe to take payments and provides credits in return.

## Future Features
I would like to build off of this tutorial and add the following features and changes to it:
* Improve survey list design
* Option to delete surveys that have been created
* Allow users to specify the from field
* Allow client side sorting of surveys
